I've bought Niz plum and tried to compare Filco majestouch which I was using
for 4 yrs.

<p>
Niz plum is an electrostatic capacitive keyboard.  Let's listen to the
typing sound on the video..  That sounds very smooth and quite
elegant.
</p>

<p>
Filco Majestouch is a mechanical keyboard, which is so tough that
I was using it very long time and it is still be useful. This sounds a
little bit loudly. Some people like this typing noise.
</p>

<p>
We can arrange Niz plum's layout with Windows apps which can download
from <a href="https://www.nizkeyboard.com/download/">here</a>. My laptop which I use at home is Mac, so I cannot use it..
